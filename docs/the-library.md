# The Library

The Library is a user-wide collection of [Instruction Files](file-format). It allows for storing Instruction Files outside of project directories. This allows for the separation of open-source projects and the specific instructions from the specific instructions for deploying them to proprietary environments.

Files in the library are managed with the [`btd`](commands) command.

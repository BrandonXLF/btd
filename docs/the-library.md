# The Library

The Library is a computer-wide collection of [Instruction Files](file-format). It allows for storing Instruction Files outside of project directories. This allows for the separation of the, potentially open-source, project and specific recipes for deploying it to proprietary environments.

Files in the library are managed with the [`btd`](commands) command.

# Installation

If you have Rust and Cargo installed ([install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)), then you can build and install `btd` with the command `cargo install btd`.

On Windows, an [installer is available for download](`https://github.com/BrandonXLF/btd/releases/latest/download/btd-installer.exe`) that installs a precompiled copy of `btd` and adds it to the `$PATH`. A [precompiled exe](`https://github.com/BrandonXLF/btd/releases/latest/download/btd.exe) is also available directly.

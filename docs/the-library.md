# The Library

The library is a user-wide collection of [instruction files](/file-format/). It allows for storing instruction files outside of project directories. This allows for the separation of open-source projects and the specific instructions from the specific instructions for deploying them to proprietary environments.

Files in the library are managed with the [`btd`](/commands/) command.

`btd` allows you to transform and deploy production builds of projects with file operations and commands using easy-to-edit YAML files.

## Convenient File Format

Transformations are stored in [Instruction Files](file-format) that are created using the easy-to-edit YAML file format. YAML makes it trivial to define multiline strings strings wile requiring minimal syntax.

## User-Wide Store

Instructions can be in codebase or in a [user-wide library](the-library) that allows for the separation of open-source projects from the specific instructions for deploying them to proprietary environments.
